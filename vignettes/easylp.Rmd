# What is EasyLP?

EasyLP is a workflow for defining, solving, and presenting complex linear problems. This package is not a solver. If you're looking for a function that takes a vector of coefficients and a constraint matrix, check out [lpSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lpSolve/index.html).
